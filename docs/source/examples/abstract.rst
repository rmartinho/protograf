----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a regular Chess board with
            brown styling and grid references.

            This example uses a Square grid with alphanumeric locations.
            These locations are then referenced and drawn with a ``Location()``
            command.

            The grid notation along the board edges is created via
            ``Sequence()`` commands.

Discussion  This example shows how to construct a regular Backgammon board.

            This uses Trapezoid shape with a very narrow *top* to represent a
            point; this can be copied across in a line using a ``Sequence()``
            command.

            There is one Sequence command for each section of the
            board |dash| top and bottom sections of each panel |dash| and each
            Sequence draws a pair of Trapezoid shapes multiple times.

----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  The code uses a basic ``Circle()``, with the *slices*
            property being used to construct the internal sectors that creates
            the "dartboard-like" effect of radiating spaces. The
            *centre_shapes* property adds more overlapping circles.

Discussion  This example shows how to construct a regular Go board.

            The script is fairly simple; the board itself is contructed from a
            ``Grid``, and relies on the default interval being ``1`` cm.

            The handicap points are constructed using a ``DotGrid``, with
            larger than default dot sizes. The DotGrid offset is from the
            *page* edge, not the margin!

Discussion  This example shows how to construct a *Hex* game board.

            The primary board is drawn using the ``Hexagons`` command, which
            specifies rows, columns and the hex layout pattern |dash| in this
            case a *diamond*.   The background edges are drawn as *slices*
            within a ``Rhombus`` shape.

HexHex Games
============
`↑ <table-of-contents-exabs_>`_

There are many games that are played on "hexagonal" board i.e. a board that is
hexagonal in outline and is composed of many hexagons.

The number of hexagons on the side of such a board is used to identify the
board size, for example; *hexhex4* is a board with 4 smaller hexagons along
each side.

            using each line's *connection* property.

Octagons
========
`↑ <table-of-contents-exabs_>`_

In Octagons, players alternate taking turns. On their turn, a player can
either fill in one half of an octagon or two squares. The player who first
forms an unbroken connection between the edges of their colour wins.

Title       *Octagons Board*

Discussion  The code uses a basic 8-sided ``Polygon()``, with the *perbii*
            property being set to construct either a horizontal or vertical
            line inside it.

            The ``Repeat()`` command is used to lay out either of these shapes
            into part of an 8x8 "grid"; choosing which rows or columns are
            used by means of the *down* or *across* properties; with some
            rows "indented" by means of the *offset_x* property.

----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Script      `snex.py <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/examples/boards/abstract/snex.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a board and then show a series
            of moves played out on that board.

            This example uses a number of different commands:

            - ``RectangularLocations()`` creates a virtual grid representing
              possible locations on a square board;
            - The ``Grid()`` command constructs the lines of the board;
            - The ``Layout()`` command places a set of ``Image`` s,
              representing all pieces placed on the board up to that turn,
              using their grid-locations as a reference;
            - The ``Star()`` command places a yellow-colored star at the
              grid-location corresponding to that of the most recently placed
              piece.

            The example requires the use of a Python list to store the moves,
            showing for each side on which grid row/column intersection their
            piece was placed.  Here ``blk`` corresponds to the black-colored
            pieces of the Black player, and ``wht`` corresponds to the
            white-colored pieces of the White player.

              .. code:: python

                turns = [
                    (blk,7,6), (wht,4,2), (blk,3,4), (wht,7,3), (blk,2,2),
                    (wht,3,6), (blk,5,5), (wht,6,6), (blk,6,5), (wht,4,4),
                ]

            The use of a `for` loop allows the program to process the moves
            and create a page for the board state as it would be after **all**
            moves *up to that point* have been carried out:

              .. code:: python

                for number, turn in enumerate(turns):
                   # create board for all turns up to this one

            Finally, the ``Save()`` command specifies output to a GIF image,
            along with the framerate (interval in seconds between showing each
            new image) and the image DPI resolution (a higher value creates
            larger images).

              .. code:: python

                Save(output='gif', dpi=150, framerate=1)

            The GIF will always "loop" |dash| starting the animation again
            once all frames have been shown.

Title       *TicTacToe Board and Game*
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Script      `tictactoe.py <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/examples/boards/abstract/tictactoe.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  This example shows how to construct a board and then show a series
            of moves played out on that board.

            This example uses ``RectangularLocations()`` to create a virtual
            grid representing the centres of each space on the board.  One
            ``Layout()`` command then places green Squares representing board
            spaces on that grid ; another ``Layout()`` command then places
            a set of colored Circles, representing all pieces placed on the
            board up to that turn, using their grid-location as a reference.

            The example requires the use of Python lists to record the moves,
            showing for each player in which grid row and column their piece
            was placed:

              .. code:: python

                turns = [(me,1,1), (you,2,2), (me,1,3), (you,1,2)]

            The use of a loop allows the program to process the moves and
            create one page for the board state as it would be after all
            moves *up to that point* have been carried out:

              .. code:: python

                for number, turn in enumerate(turns):
                   # create board for all turns up to this one

            Finally, the ``Save()`` command specifies output to a GIF image,
            along with the framerate (interval in seconds between showing
            each new image).

              .. code:: python

                Save(output='gif', framerate=0.5)

            The GIF will always "loop" |dash| starting the animation again
            once all images have been shown.

New Classic Games

`↑ <table-of-contents-exabs_>`_

In February 2026, Brian E. Svoboda release a small booklet, in PDF format,
containing boards and rules for a number of abstract games, titled
*"A NEW BOOK OF CLASSIC BOARD GAMES"*.  This booklet was discussed at
Board Game Geek in this forum: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3357842

The script linked here is an attempt to reproduce the boards from that booklet.

.. NOTE::

    The script does not currently reproduce the "King's Valley" board;
    this is still a work-in-progress.

Script      `new_classics.py <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/examples/boards/abstract/new_classics.py>`_
----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion  The script uses different techniques and commands for each board;
            some are simple, but some are quite long and/or complex.

            Only the screenshots for a few of the boards are shown here:

            - Cairo Corridor
            - Chinese Checkers
            - Strands
            - Volo

            Another related script, linked here for interest is an example of
            drawing a diagram that would be used in a rules document - see
